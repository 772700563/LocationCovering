> Benders Decomposition for Very Large Scale Partial Set Covering and Maximal Covering Problems  
Fabio Furini, Ivana Ljubic and Jean-Francois.


The Branch-and-Benders-cut algorithm for Maximal Covering Location and  partial set covering location problems (described in the publication mentioned above) can be downloaded by clicking here (see the files above). To use the solver, a license file is provided. To compile and run the code  CPLEX libraries are required.

The solver can be run as, e.g.,

./[exeNAME] GRID_MCLP_n100_m10000_d1_100_f1_1_s1.dat 2 600  6.25 10

For the instance format, see the dedicated file. The software is for academic purposes only, see also the file license.md  provided.
